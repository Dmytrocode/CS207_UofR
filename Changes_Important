The gesture control device did not end up working after spending hours trying to modify the code and make hardware / electronic changes.

For this reason, I decided to make another modification to the product. Instead of using a gesture control device to control the movement of 
the robotic car, I will use a Smartphone bluetooth app that will connect to the arduino, and control it from there.
