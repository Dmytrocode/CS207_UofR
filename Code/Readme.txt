This folder contains the code files written and executable by the Arduino IDE. The files with "OLDER" are the files that belonged to
the old project when a gesture control Nano V3 setup was used to control the robotic car. After that, this control device was replaced 
by a smartphone buetooth app that connets to the Robotic car directly.
