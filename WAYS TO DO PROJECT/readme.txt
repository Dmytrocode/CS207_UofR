There are two ways to make this project work. 

1. through a Gesture Control Device that instructs the robotic car how to move. For this, make sure you GET THE RIGHT MOTOR SHIELD for your
Arduino. 
(PLEASE RETURN TO THE MAIN DIRECTORY AND USE BOTH "CODE" AND "LIBRARIES" FOLDERS FOR THIS OPTION).


2. Through a Smartphone bluetooth app, that would connect to a bluetooth device built in the robotic car, and it would control
its movement through the appâ€™s buttons / IDE.
